# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! The goal of this challenge is to dedicate time each day to coding and complete 100 projects over the next 100 days.

## Motivation

The purpose of this challenge is to:

- Build a consistent coding habit
- Strengthen my programming skills
- Explore new technologies and languages
- Build a portfolio of 100 projects

## Rules

1. Code for a minimum of 1 hour every day.
2. Commit code to GitHub for each project.
3. Share progress on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
4. Reflect on the day's progress in the log file.

## Projects

Below is a list of projects I aim to complete during this challenge:

1. Project 1: [BMI Calulator]("https://github.com/midhun-r/100Days_of_Code/blob/main/BMI_Calculator")


Feel free to join me on this coding journey, and let's learn and grow together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
